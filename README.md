My Approach about how I have chosen this algorithm was related to how the myarrays is increasing given two position (i,j) in a value (k). its like a sum++ but managing each position well and at the end I sort the array to return the max value.

Time Complexity O(n^2) - The Method GetMaxValue iterates over the operations(variable) and we have a nested loop that iterates twice.

# Twago-Challengue
Task: You get a list (initialized to 0) of size X. You need to perform Y operations on it and print the maximum value of all final values of all the Y elements in the list. For each operation, 3 integers are given - i,j and k and you have to add value k to all the elements in the range of index i to j (both inclusive).
